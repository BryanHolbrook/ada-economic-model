# Diagram of Cardano's ADA Token & Economic Model
A diagram generated in Matplotlib of Cardano's Economic Model and how the ADA token functions within.

The diagram illustrates how the ADA token flows throughout the system, highlighting the interactions between different economic actors and system modules:

Key Components:

*  ADA Holders: Central actors who own ADA tokens and can choose to stake, participate in governance, or interact with dApps.
*  Stake Pool Operators: Manage stake pools, validate transactions, and help secure the network.
*  Validators: Selected from stake pool operators to validate transactions and create new blocks, earning rewards.
*  Governance Participants: ADA holders who vote on proposals affecting the networkâ€™s future.
*  dApp Users: Individuals who spend ADA to interact with decentralized applications.
*  Treasury: Collects transaction fees and funds from newly minted ADA, which is used to
support ongoing development and community projects.

System Modules:
*  Cardano Settlement Layer (CSL): Manages ADA transactions.
*  Cardano Computation Layer (CCL): Facilitates smart contracts and dApps.
*  Staking Module: Where ADA is staked, and rewards are distributed.
*  Governance Module: Facilitates on-chain voting and decision-making.
*  Treasury: Allocates funds for future development and projects.
